                <h3>The Anti Drug Abuse Act (1986)</h3>
                <p>The Anti Drug Abuse act of 1986 set the legal precedent that black people would be more likely to get convicted for drug abuse and receive a harsher punishment than their white counterparts.

                    This law set a legal minimum for the possession of Cocaine. Crack is much cheaper to produce than its powered version, therefore being cheaper and more accessible to lower income communities (Which are predominantly black). The Anti Drug Abuse law was passed with the mindset that crack cocaine is more dangerous and addictive, even though itâ€™s been proven that there is no pharmacological difference between the two. This act mandated a minimum sentence of 5 years without parole for possession of 5 grams of crack cocaine while it mandated the same for possession of 500 grams of powder cocaine. Although this disparity was later reduced from 100:1 to 18:1 in 2010 by Obama. This law established a trend of the mass incarceration of black communities we see today.

                    Since the passage of this law, in the 1990s African Americans accounted for 53.2% of those in state prisons for drugs, whereas white people accounted for 38.2 percent. By 2012 we had a total of around 2.6million people incarcerated
